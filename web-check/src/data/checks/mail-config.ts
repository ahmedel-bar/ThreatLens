    'was signed by the domain and not altered. Web Check looks for it under common ' +
    'selector names, so "Not found" does not prove there is no key. DMARC tells ' +
    'receivers what to do with mail that fails both SPF and DKIM. A policy of none ' +
    "only monitors, so the checklist ticks DMARC once it's set to quarantine or " +
    'reject. BIMI is an optional logo, and most domains skip it.',

    'Without a DMARC policy of quarantine or reject, anyone can send mail with the ' +
    "domain in the From line. SPF alone doesn't stop this, because it checks a hidden " +
    "envelope address, not the one people see. Mistakes hurt the domain's own mail " +
    'too. If there are two SPF records, or one that needs more than 10 DNS lookups, ' +
    'SPF fails for every message. The MX hosts and SPF includes name the mail ' +
    'provider and many of the vendors allowed to send, a quick way to map who an ' +
